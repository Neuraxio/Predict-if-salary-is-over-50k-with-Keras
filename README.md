# Predict if salary is >50k with machine learning

A neural network with a single layer (sigmoid activation) will be used to predict if someone makes more than 50k or less based on training and test data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

## Dependencies 

- Python 3.0 (Anaconda distribution is preferred)
- Theano (requires linux)
- Keras (requires Theano)
- iPython notebook (included in Anaconda bundle - run `ipython notebook` in terminal from the project's directory)
